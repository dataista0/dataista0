## 😽 News 

- *Dec 2nd, 2024*: We integrated Agentless with Claude 3.5 Sonnet to achieve 40.7% and 50.8% solve rate on SWE-bench lite and verified 
- *Oct 28th, 2024*: We just released OpenAutoCoder-Agentless 1.5! 
- *July 1st, 2024*: We just released OpenAutoCoder-Agentless 1.0! **Agentless** currently is the best open-source approach on SWE-bench lite with 82 fixes (27.3%) and costing on average $0.34 per issue.

## 😺 About 

**Agentless** is an *agentless* approach to automatically solve software development problems. To solve each issue, **Agentless** follows a simple three phase process: localization, repair, and patch validation.
- 🙀 **Localization**: Agentless employs a hierarchical process to first localize the fault to specific files, then to relevant classes or functions, and finally to fine-grained edit locations
- 😼 **Repair**: Agentless takes the edit locations and samples multiple candidate patches per bug in a simple diff format
- 😸 **Patch Validation**: Agentless selects the regression tests to run and generates additional reproduction test to reproduce the original error. Using the test results, Agentless re-ranks all remaining patches to selects one to submit

## 🐈 Setup

First create the environment 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless.git
cd Agentless

conda create -n agentless python=3.11 
conda activate agentless
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
```

<details><summary>⏬ Developer Setup</summary>
<div>

```shell
# for contribution, please install the pre-commit hook.
pre-commit install  # this allows a more standardized code style
```

</div>
</details>

Then export your OpenAI API key 
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY={key_here}
```

Now you are ready to run **Agentless** on the problems in SWE-bench! 

> [!NOTE]
> 
> To reproduce the full SWE-bench lite experiments and follow our exact setup as described in the paper. Please see this [README](https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless/blob/main/README_swebench.md)

## 🧶 Comparison

Below shows the comparison graph between **Agentless** and the best open-source agent-based approaches on SWE-bench lite
